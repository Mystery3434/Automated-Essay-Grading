It was my turn to take the shovel, but I felt too ashamed to dutifully send her off when I had not properly said goodbye. I refused to throw dirt on her. I refused to let go of my grandmother, to accept a death I had not seen coming, to believe that an illness could not only interrupt, but steal a beloved life.When my parents finally revealed to me that my grandmother had been battling liver cancer, I was twelve and I was angry--mostly with myself. They had wanted to protect me--only six years old at the time--from the complex and morose concept of death. However, when the end inevitably arrived, I wasn\\u2019t trying to comprehend what dying was; I was trying to understand how I had been able to abandon my sick grandmother in favor of playing with friends and watching TV. Hurt that my parents had deceived me and resentful of my own oblivion, I committed myself to preventing such blindness from resurfacing.I became desperately devoted to my education because I saw knowledge as the key to freeing myself from the chains of ignorance. While learning about cancer in school I promised myself that I would memorize every fact and absorb every detail in textbooks and online medical journals. And as I began to consider my future, I realized that what I learned in school would allow me to silence that which had silenced my grandmother. However, I was focused not with learning itself, but with good grades and high test scores. I started to believe that academic perfection would be the only way to redeem myself in her eyes--to make up for what I had not done as a granddaughter.  \"", "processed_body": {"wordfrequency_all": 26739.079847908746, "wordfrequency_content": 1370.768472906404, "wordfrequency_function": 87065.9018404908, "wordrangescore": 519.2813688212927, "academicwordscore": 0.08433734939759036, "sublist1score": 0.07142857142857142, "sublist2score": 0.2857142857142857, "sublist3score": 0.0, "sublist4score": 0.07142857142857142, "sublist5score": 0.14285714285714285, "sublist6score": 0.14285714285714285, "sublist7score": 0.07142857142857142, "sublist8score": 0.14285714285714285, "sublist9score": 0.07142857142857142, "sublist10score": 0.0, "familiarityscore": 574.7717391304348, "concretenessscore": 398.14285714285717, "imagabilityscore": 417.2717391304348, "meaningfulnesscscore": 440.32394366197184, "meaningfulnesspscore": 549.9, "ageofacquisitionscore": 315.4736842105263, "flesch_reading_ease": 52.33, "flesch_kincaid_grade_level": 12.7, "smog": 12.7, "coleman_liau": 9.46, "ari": 14.2, "semanticoverlap": 126, "typetokenratio": {"They": 2, "covered": 1, "the": 8, "precious": 1, "mahogany": 1, "coffin": 1, "with": 5, "a": 4, "brown": 1, "amalgam": 1, "of": 6, "rocks": 1, "decomposed": 1, "organisms": 1, "and": 8, "weeds": 1, "It": 1, "was": 6, "my": 10, "turn": 1, "to": 18, "take": 1, "shovel": 1, "but": 3, "I": 20, "felt": 1, "too": 1, "ashamed": 1, "dutifully": 1, "send": 1, "her": 3, "off": 1, "when": 2, "had": 8, "not": 5, "properly": 1, "said": 1, "goodbye": 1, "refused": 2, "throw": 1, "dirt": 1, "on": 1, "let": 1, "go": 1, "grandmother": 4, "accept": 1, "death": 2, "seen": 1, "coming": 1, "believe": 2, "that": 7, "an": 1, "illness": 1, "could": 1, "only": 2, "interrupt": 1, "steal": 1, "beloved": 1, "lifeWhen": 1, "parents": 2, "finally": 1, "revealed": 1, "me": 3, "been": 2, "battling": 1, "liver": 1, "cancer": 2, "twelve": 1, "angrymostly": 1, "myself": 5, "wanted": 1, "protect": 1, "meonly": 1, "six": 1, "years": 1, "old": 1, "at": 1, "timefrom": 1, "complex": 1, "morose": 1, "concept": 1, "However": 2, "end": 1, "inevitably": 1, "arrived": 1, "wasnu2019t": 1, "trying": 2, "comprehend": 1, "what": 3, "dying": 1, "understand": 1, "how": 1, "able": 1, "abandon": 1, "sick": 1, "in": 5, "favor": 1, "playing": 1, "friends": 1, "watching": 1, "TV": 1, "Hurt": 1, "deceived": 1, "resentful": 1, "own": 1, "oblivion": 1, "committed": 1, "preventing": 1, "such": 1, "blindness": 1, "from": 2, "resurfacingI": 1, "became": 1, "desperately": 1, "devoted": 1, "education": 1, "because": 1, "saw": 1, "knowledge": 1, "as": 3, "key": 1, "freeing": 1, "chains": 1, "ignorance": 1, "While": 1, "learning": 2, "about": 1, "school": 2, "promised": 1, "would": 3, "memorize": 1, "every": 2, "fact": 1, "absorb": 1, "detail": 1, "textbooks": 1, "online": 1, "medical": 1, "journals": 1, "And": 1, "began": 1, "consider": 1, "future": 1, "realized": 1, "learned": 1, "allow": 1, "silence": 1, "which": 1, "silenced": 1, "focused": 1, "itself": 1, "good": 1, "grades": 1, "high": 1, "test": 1, "scores": 1, "started": 1, "academic": 1, "perfection": 1, "be": 1, "way": 1, "redeem": 1, "eyesto": 1, "make": 1, "up": 1, "for": 1, "done": 1, "granddaughter": 1}, "holistic_score": 0.979085385799408}, "val": 0.01}===>OK 3
