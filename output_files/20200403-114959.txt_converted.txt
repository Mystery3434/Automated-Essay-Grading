Teaching methods play a significant role in students' understanding of unfamiliar concepts. When students' first exposure to the reading material contains excessive technical jargon, they may find difficulties in articulating their ideas about these concepts (McDonnel et al., 2016). If technical jargon is used in teaching without covering the same concepts using more "natural" language, students find it more difficult to link technical and non-technical terms together. The same problem presents itself when students are taught exclusively using non-technical language (Mulwa 2015). Furthermore, when the explanation of complex concepts is done solely from a theoretical perspective, without any real-life demonstrations, many students are unable to visualize these concepts clearly (Maoto & Masha, 2015).
