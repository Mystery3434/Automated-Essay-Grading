“Would you like to fly to St. Lucia?" Mr. Martin asked.  
”I’m not sure!" replied Lucy, "is it nice?"  
“St. Lucia is lovely, Lucy," said Mr. Martin, "especially St. Jame's Bay along Chapel St."  
“Then we shall go to Chapel St., St. Jame's Bay, St. Lucia Mr. Martin!", she said.  
And so they left the U.S.A. They departed immediately.
