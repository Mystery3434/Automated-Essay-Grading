He is one of Hollywood\\u2019s superstars and received an Academy Award nomination in 1995 but has yet to win an Oscar. He often tops the \\u201cmost handsome guy in the world\\u201d lists. He was married to Jennifer Aniston for five years and is now married to Angelina Jolie, with whom he has six children. Brad was born in 1963 in Oklahoma. His father owned a trucking company and his mother was a school counsellor. He was an active student and enjoyed debating and acting. He studied journalism at the University of Missouri but his heart wasn\\u2019t really in reporting. He didn\\u2019t finish his degree but instead drove to Hollywood to look for fame. In 1988, Pitt landed his first role in 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix', which was filmed in the parts of Scotland. He attracted great attention in the hit movie \\u2018Thelma & Louise\\u2019. This made him a sex symbol after he was filmed topless wearing a cowboy hat. Pitt slowly got bigger roles, including Robert Redford's \\u2018A River Runs Through It\\u2019 in 1992. In 1994, his role in \\u2018Interview with a Vampire\\u2019 launched him into the big time as Hollywood\\u2019s hottest actor. Other blockbusters followed, including \\u2018Se7en\\u2019, \\u2018Fight Club\\u2019, \\u2018Twelve Monkeys\\u2019 and \\u2018Ocean\\u2019s Eleven\\u2019. Pitt has used his fame to help the homeless in New Orleans. He is also behind the organization Not On Our Watch, which raises awareness of the suffering in Darfur.\"", "processed_body": {"wordfrequency_all": 99.78548873405154, "wordfrequency_content": 968.4193548387096, "wordfrequency_function": 106080.88333333333, "wordrangescore": 244.29444444444445, "academicwordscore": 0.04430379746835443, "sublist1score": 0.42857142857142855, "sublist2score": 0.0, "sublist3score": 0.14285714285714285, "sublist4score": 0.14285714285714285, "sublist5score": 0.2857142857142857, "sublist6score": 0.0, "sublist7score": 0.0, "sublist8score": 0.0, "sublist9score": 0.0, "sublist10score": 0.0, "familiarityscore": 86.63262938036667, "concretenessscore": 402.35185185185185, "imagabilityscore": 440.75409836065575, "meaningfulnesscscore": 442.9591836734694, "meaningfulnesspscore": 626.3333333333334, "ageofacquisitionscore": 345.9375, "grammar_errorrate": 95.95141700404858, "flesch_reading_ease": 73.68, "flesch_kincaid_grade_level": 6.6, "smog": 39.23076923076923, "coleman_liau": 10.84, "ari": 10.1, "semanticoverlap": 97, "typetokenratio": {"Brad": 2, "Pitt": 4, "is": 4, "an": 4, "American": 1, "actor": 2, "and": 8, "film": 1, "producer": 1, "He": 8, "one": 1, "of": 5, "Hollywoodu2019s": 2, "superstars": 1, "received": 1, "Academy": 1, "Award": 1, "nomination": 1, "in": 12, "1995": 1, "but": 3, "has": 3, "yet": 1, "to": 6, "win": 1, "Oscar": 1, "often": 1, "tops": 1, "the": 11, "u201cmost": 1, "handsome": 1, "guy": 1, "worldu201d": 1, "lists": 1, "was": 6, "married": 2, "Jennifer": 1, "Aniston": 1, "for": 2, "five": 1, "years": 1, "now": 1, "Angelina": 1, "Jolie": 1, "with": 2, "whom": 1, "he": 2, "six": 1, "children": 1, "born": 1, "1963": 1, "Oklahoma": 1, "His": 1, "father": 1, "owned": 1, "a": 5, "trucking": 1, "company": 1, "his": 6, "mother": 1, "school": 1, "counsellor": 1, "active": 1, "student": 1, "enjoyed": 1, "debating": 1, "acting": 1, "studied": 1, "journalism": 1, "at": 1, "University": 1, "Missouri": 1, "heart": 1, "wasnu2019t": 1, "really": 1, "reporting": 1, "didnu2019t": 1, "finish": 1, "degree": 1, "instead": 1, "drove": 1, "Hollywood": 1, "look": 1, "fame": 2, "In": 2, "1988": 1, "landed": 1, "first": 1, "role": 2, "Harry": 1, "Potter": 1, "Order": 1, "Phoenix": 1, "which": 2, "filmed": 2, "parts": 1, "Scotland": 1, "attracted": 1, "great": 1, "attention": 1, "hit": 1, "movie": 1, "u2018Thelma": 1, "Louiseu2019": 1, "This": 1, "made": 1, "him": 2, "sex": 1, "symbol": 1, "after": 1, "topless": 1, "wearing": 1, "cowboy": 1, "hat": 1, "slowly": 1, "got": 1, "bigger": 1, "roles": 1, "including": 2, "Robert": 1, "Redfords": 1, "u2018A": 1, "River": 1, "Runs": 1, "Through": 1, "Itu2019": 1, "1992": 1, "1994": 1, "u2018Interview": 1, "Vampireu2019": 1, "launched": 1, "into": 1, "big": 1, "time": 1, "as": 1, "hottest": 1, "Other": 1, "blockbusters": 1, "followed": 1, "u2018Se7enu2019": 1, "u2018Fight": 1, "Clubu2019": 1, "u2018Twelve": 1, "Monkeysu2019": 1, "u2018Oceanu2019s": 1, "Elevenu2019": 1, "used": 1, "help": 1, "homeless": 1, "New": 1, "Orleans": 1, "also": 1, "behind": 1, "organization": 1, "Not": 1, "On": 1, "Our": 1, "Watch": 1, "raises": 1, "awareness": 1, "suffering": 1, "Darfur": 1}, "holistic_score": 76.44791007041931, "fact_status": "", "fact_count": 0, "accuracy_score": 0.0, "feedback_text": "The essay recorded a low grammar error rate.
