Proofreading might help improve the essay, but not by much. The readability of the essay is considered equivalent to that of middle school level writing. The essay does not incorporates enough academic terminology and may not be considered appropriate as a piece of academic writing. The word variety is good with usage of both common and uncommon words. A strong vocabulary is demonstrated in this response. The word choice of the essay excels in familiarity, suggesting that the essay excels in expression. The factual accuracy checked against the provided facts is deemed relatively low. We suggest going back to see if you have successfully supported all factual claims as required in the essay. "}, "val": 0.01}===>OK 3
