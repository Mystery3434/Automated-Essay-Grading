Dear to whom it may concern, 

I am currently in pursuit of an endeavour to explore a career in information technology (IT). Particularly keen on building on my technical knowledge to utilize and develop IT solutions, I believe my experiences have equipped me with a well-rounded skill set that makes me a suitable candidate.  As a final year computer science student, I carry fresh exposure to several of many programming languages and latest technological solutions that make me an insightful asset. Over the past summer, I served as an intern at the Logistics and Supply Chain MultiTech R&D Centre, where taking part in an Internet of Things security testbed project, I assisted in the front-end development of an interactive user-interface for a security threat logger in a Programmable Logic Controller. Additionally, using Linux shell codes, I helped to run test cases and factorize code for the deployment of a private Hyperledger blockchain network. As a result, my colleagues were able to efficiently debug and thus substantially accelerate the development process. My active partaking in collaborative software development projects has henceforth also equipped me with the skills and comfort of working in a team environment. Furthermore, I possess the diligence and strong work ethic that allow me to compete effectively in a dynamic environment. My leadership roles in the Hong Kong Institute of Engineers CUHK Student Chapter and the International Students Association CUHK have endowed me with the communication and interpersonal skills to interact with a variety of people and build expanding networks.  Finally, I am confident in my abilities, and I believe my open-mindedness and readiness to learn will enable me to thrive in any role. Thank you in advance for your consideration. 

Sincerely, Anju Otsuka
